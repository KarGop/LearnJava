Example:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
/*

class Solution {
   public String reverseWords(String s)
{
	String[] words = s.split(" ");
	StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(words.length); //String in Java is immutable and if we try appending a new word to the result, it will lead us to extremely inefficient use of memory.
     
	for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
	{
		if (words[i].length() != 0)
		{
			if (result.length() != 0)
			{
				result.append(" ");
			}
			result.append(words[i]);
		}
	}

	return result.toString(); //we have to return String rather than StringBuilder
}
}
